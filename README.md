Under Supervised machine Learning using Linear Regression model to predict car price 
Geely Auto is a Chinese automobile company that wants to enter the US market. They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market. The consulting firm has gathered a large data set of different types of cars across the America market. The business goal is to model the price of cars with the available independent variables, which can be used by management to manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. The dataset provided is for learning purpose and should not be drawn any inference with real world scenario.

using linear regression y=mx+c i was a to creat a model to predict real numbers(car price) where y= Target variable and mx+c = independent variable.
in this case price =y and mx + c = variables
